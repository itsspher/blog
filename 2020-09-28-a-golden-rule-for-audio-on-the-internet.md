title: a golden rule for audio on the internet
---

the rule is this:

> Your viewer/listener **should not** have to touch the volume of their device to watch/listen to your content.

you are not special. people watch and listen to tons of content online, all at a consistent volume. you should not be any different.

match the volume of your content with others' volume.

there should be **ZERO** volume fluctuations that require volume adjustment.

this requires that you take a sample of content from the platform, note the average volume, and match your content to theirs. this also requires you to have a different file for each platform you wish to upload to. 

that is the kind of attention to detail that you need to succeed as a content creator.

with the resources that are available these days to teach yourself audio editing, **there is no excuse to break this rule**.
