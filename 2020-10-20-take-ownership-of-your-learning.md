title: take ownership of your learning
---

we've been there. the lecturer is as engaging as watching paint dry. you don't know why you need this class for your course. perhaps you're in high school, and don't see why you need to take calculus if you're going to do a humanities or art degree anyway. i feel you. i've been there myself.

you have many issues with a class, and you see a lot of obstacles between you and a high grade. the teacher sucks. the material is (seemingly) unrelated to what you actually want to do. quizzes are hard, exams more so. not to mention that internal feeling of stupidity, and putting yourself down for not understanding what other seem to absorb with ease.

well, those are the obstacles. you can't control those. what can you do? well, let's take stock of what is in your control:

- your attitude
- your will
- your time
- your state of mind

different teachers teach in different ways. different students will take different things from different teachers. a teacher might suck for you, but for someone else they're very enlightening. **you can't control the teacher**, but **you can control how you learn**. you can adapt your techniques. you can seek alternative means of grasping the topic, and you can grind through material in order to make the knowledge stick. you can restructure your day so you have more time to work on a topic.

you can change your attitude. you can stop putting yourself down for being "stupid" or "dumb". would you be taking this class if you already knew the material? no, of course not, so why put yourself down for not knowing things, when **the whole point of going to a class is to learn things**.

learning is difficult. you're literally making new connections in your brain, altering the physical makeup of the neurons in your mind. it's similar to physical exercise. exercise is supposed to be difficult because you don't yet have the muscles to make it feel easy. 

what can you do? change your attitude towards that difficulty. it's inevitable, it's out of your control. accept it, and push through. find anything and everything you can do to tackle the subject, and do that.

take ownership of how you learn.
