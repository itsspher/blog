title: on moddable games
---

i've often told my friends (and unwilling passerby) about why moddable games are always better than unmoddable games. here, i'll attempt to refine my points into a single essay.

# your own taste

when you go to a restaurant over here, there will often be a platter of sauces and saucers in the center of the table. usually, these will be complimenting condiments, like soy sauce, vinegar, chilis and chili oil, etc.etc. the point of the restaurant serving this as a *default* is for the customer to mix and match the condiments in order to make their own sauce. the chef wont come out of the kitchen to scream that "you shouldn't be putting soy sauce on ice cream" but rather they encourage you to modify and mix their flavors with your own.

moddable games offer the same sort of freedom. the developers offer a good base, from which you're able to customize your experience based on what you want from the game. like it or not, different people can look for different things from the same game. perhaps you like the building aspect of *Minecraft*, rather than the survival aspect. maybe you like the rpg elements of *Skyrim*, rather than the combat aspect. maybe you just like seeing anime tiddy in all of your games, or you don't want any explicit content to distract you. you're allowed to change the game to suit your wishes.

after all, no one knows what you want better than you.

# a limited life

a games *lifespan*, to me, is defined as the time a person will spend with a game before dropping the game entirely. some games are designed to be 2 hour cinematic experiences. others are designed to be 1000 hour grindfests. but most games are designed for 10-12 hours of single player time. 

moddable games, theoretically, have near-infinite lifespans. as new content is modded into the game, more time is spent by players exploring that content. mods can overhaul the entire game, which not only adds more life, but can revive an inert game and bring back players who have finished the vanilla experience.

take the *Pokemon* modding community. *Pokemon* games have a set story line and a limited competitive life, since one generation's competitive scene dies as a new generation is pushed out. however, with the advent of tools to modify old games and add new content, people often come back to modded *Pokemon* games and play through them as if they were a new game.

take another example, *S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Call of Pripyat (SCoP)*. it's an outdated game with poor graphics and a game engine that's made of styrofoam and tears, yet it has an active community, and an active playerbase. this is owed to the its modding scene. modders take the game and run with it, creating overhauls for graphics, sound design, quest systems, combat, and more. a fully modded game of *SCoP* plays like a completely different game from the vanilla experience. the amount of life an 11 year old game has due to it's modding community is unlike what it would be unmodded.
