title: a year later
---

this blog has moved from hatena to my personal wiki, hosted on github. the good thing about this is that blog entries are just markdown files being turned into html, so when github goes down, i can host these html files elsewhere.

how are you? i haven't written like this in a while. a lot has changed in a year. a lot has changed about the world. a lot has changed about you i bet.

entries on this blog will probably make it into the [personal wiki](scion-index) at some point in the future. this is where i intend to write more narrative and less factual content.

i guess i'll see you next time then.
