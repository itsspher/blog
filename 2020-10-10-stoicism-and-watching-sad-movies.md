title: stoicism and watching sad movies
---

so you want to be a stoic. you're sold on the act of ridding yourself of negative emotion, and have begun your practice of negative visualization. however, there's a problem you've encountered, one that neither the ancient greeks nor the romans had a solution for:

**how do you deal with works of art designed to make you feel negative emotions?**

i'll give benefit of the doubt to the ancient philosophers. perhaps they didn't have a wealth of works that move people to tears, or maybe they just didn't see this as a problem, or perhaps they did write or talk about this at some point, it just wasn't archived. regardless, we don't have any primary source for how to deal with this problem, and it's up to us modern stoics (or stoics-in-training) to deal with this.

first, we need to learn the difference between the emotions we feel from negative events and emotions we feel from works of art. while they *may feel similar*, they are in fact, *different in nature*.

negative events are often unexpected, and are *always unwanted*. as rational human beings, we don't sign ourselves up for misery. the negative emotions that we experience as a consequence of negative events often involve some element of shock or surprise, an element of powerlessness, and an element of crisis.

when we view works of art however, *we sign ourselves up to experience the art as it is*. we willingly allow ourselves to feel the emotions that the creator of the work wants us to feel. we are in control of ourselves when we view works of art. 

here's the thing about signing up to view works of art: it's a limited time offer. we only give so much time to a single work of art. for movies, tv shows, music, and other timed media, it's the duration of that media. for books, it's until we turn the final page. for visual media like paintings, sculptures, and the like, it's as long as we keep our gaze on them. we are not only in control when we choose to view art, *we are also in control of the time we give to art*.

so here's how we deal with emotions from art: **allow it**. allow yourself to experience the emotions you signed up for. allow it only for as long as you give time to the art, then stop it when you're done. it is you who gives permission to art, and it's you who can take it away. leverage the tactics of the rational stoic, and allow your rationality to remove negative emotions when you're done with them.

that's how to remain a stoic when watching sad movies.
