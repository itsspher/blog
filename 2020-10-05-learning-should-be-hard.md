title: learning should be hard
---

a common theme i've seen in my days in formal education is that students complain a lot. they complain that they don't get the material, that the tests are unreasonable, that the professor doesn't make sense. this is coming from a fellow student, and at times the complaints are unreasonable. the main reason is this: students are lazy. 

while it is students that willingly sign up for the degree program/diploma, they don't want to do the hard work to get it. they want the knowledge spoon fed. they want clear cut instructions and set directions for what to do. 

what happens to these students when they leave academia? if they get their way, they constantly are spoonfed knowledge and facts, what happens to them in the real world? where people don't accommodate you, where processes and schedules are messy, where people are not there for you at all.

students (specifically college students) are coddled by "well-meaning" professors and are left with a gimped ability to handle the real world. the solution? challenge. hardship. students need to be wrought out like iron, forged in difficult tasks that constantly test their skills, not only in their field, but also in time management, mindfulness, and maturity.

learning should be hard. if someone is not willing to do the work, to grind out materials and make the knowledge stick, then that person is not willing to learn.

yes, there will be unreasonable professors. yes, the learning materials will be opaque. yes, there are some tests that you can't be reasonable expected to pass, no matter how much you study.

however, difficulty is not a valid complaint. if it isn't difficult, you aren't learning.
